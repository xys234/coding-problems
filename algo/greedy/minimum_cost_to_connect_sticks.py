You have some sticks with positive integer lengths.

You can connect any two sticks of lengths X and Y into one stick by paying a cost of X + Y. You perform this action until there is one stick remaining.

Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.

Example 1:

Input: ropes = [8, 4, 6, 12]
Output: 58
Explanation: The optimal way to connect ropes is as follows
1. Connect the ropes of length 4 and 6 (cost is 10). Ropes after connecting: [8, 10, 12]
2. Connect the ropes of length 8 and 10 (cost is 18). Ropes after connecting: [18, 12]
3. Connect the ropes of length 18 and 12 (cost is 30).
Total cost to connect the ropes is 10 + 18 + 30 = 58
Example 2:

Input: ropes = [20, 4, 8, 2]
Output: 54
Example 3:

Input: ropes = [1, 2, 5, 10, 35, 89]
Output: 224
Example 4:

Input: ropes = [2, 2, 3, 3]
Output: 20


Constraints:

1 <= sticks.length <= 10^4
1 <= sticks[i] <= 10^4
